        <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (400g) long grain parboiled rice</li> 
                    <li>1.2kg (2.6lbs) hard chicken (hen)</li> 
                    <li>5 plum tomatoes</li> 
                    <li>3 tatashe peppers</li> 
                    <li>2 onions</li> 
                    <li>A medium piece of ginger</li> 
                    <li>1 cup (200g) tomato paste</li>  
                    <li>Â½ cup vegetable oil for frying the tomatoes</li> 
                    <li>2 Knorr cubes</li> 
                    <li>1 habanero pepper (or to taste)</li>  
                    <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li> 
                    <li> 2 teaspoons black pepper</li> 
                    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>  
                    <li>1 tablespoon curry powder (Nigerian curry powder)</li> 
                    <li>5 bay leaves (optional)</li> 
                    <li>2 teaspoons liquid smoke</li> 
            </ul>

            <h3>Cooking guide</h3>
            <p><strong>prepare your Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Blend the sweet pepper (de-seeded), tomatoes (de-seeded), Habanero pepper, half an onion (chopped) with ginger juice.</li>
                <li>Prepare the tomato stew. Boil the tomato puree till all the water dries up then fry with the vegetable oil and add a diluted tomato paste later and fry till all the tangy taste of tomatoes is gone.</li>
                <li>If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces. Cook with the thyme, Knorr cubes, half of the black pepper, 1 onion (chopped) and the bay leaves. I use a pressure cooker to reduce the cooking time of the hard chicken. When done, grill it in an oven. You may also deep-fry it. This is to give it a golden look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.</li>
                <li>Parboil the rice</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li>
                <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt, black pepper and liquid smoke. Stir. The water level should be the same level of the rice.</li> 
                <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up</li>
                <li>If you parboiled the rice as shown in the video below, the rice should be done by the time the water is dry. Taste to confirm</li>
                <li>Stir with a spatula and transfer the rice to a cool contain so it will stop cooking.</li>
            </ol>
